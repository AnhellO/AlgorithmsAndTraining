AlgorithmsAndTraining
=====================

Training with different books of mathematics, algorithms, data structures and problem solving. 
This is a part of my training for programming contests. It's a hobby too. 
I will be adding the solutions to the different exercises proposed by the books and another references used to train,
and also I will be adding an explanation taken from the book for every different topic and exercise.
The solutions will be added in C++, Python and Java.
