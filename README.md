AlgorithmsAndTraining
=====================

Training with different books of mathematics, algorithms, data structures and problem solving. Feel free to add any algorithm about any topic. Also, there will be a library in the repo, you can contribute to make it bigger.
I will be adding the solutions to the different exercises proposed by the books and another references used to train, and sometimes I will explain them too. Please, if you are using one of more references to your algorithm solution, consider to add the reference to it.
The solutions can be added in any programming language you want.
