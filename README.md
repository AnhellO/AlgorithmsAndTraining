AlgorithmsAndTraining
=====================

Training with different books of mathematics, algorithms, data structures and problem solving. Feel free to add any algorithm about any topic. Also, there will be a library in the repo, you can contribute to make it bigger.
I will be adding the algorithm implementations and the solutions to the different exercises proposed by the books and another references used to train, and sometimes I will explain them too. Before doing any contribution, please, consider this:

1.- If you are using one or more references to your algorithm solution, add the reference to it.

2.- The solutions can be added in any programming language you want.

3.- The algorithms will be classified with their respective topic, for example, for Sorting Algorithms, there will be a folder named "Sorting", with the sample codes, if there is no folder about an algorithm topic, add it to the repo. It would really good to keep the repo organized.

4.- If you can explain your algorithm, it would be good :)

5.- Feel free to add your algorithm implementation(s) in any programming language, even if there exists an actual implementation about that algorithm in another programming lenguage (or in the same programming language. Whether exists another implementation or not, you can add your file(s) with your name at the end, i.e. "Merge Sort implementation by AnhellO")

6.- Contributing with other(s) implementations is the main goal ;)
